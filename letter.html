            <p>Dear Danielli, <br>

                I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to wish you a happy birthday and let you know how much I appreciate you. Even though we may not know each other very well, I wanted to let you know that you have caught my attention and I have been thinking about you a lot lately.
                Your birthday is a special occasion, and I hope that this year brings you much happiness, success, and love. As someone who has been admiring you from afar, I wanted to take this opportunity to express my feelings for you. You are a truly special person, and I find myself drawn to your kind heart, your intelligence, and your sense of humor.
                I know that I am a shy person, and I may not have the courage to express my feelings in person, but I wanted you to know that I am thinking of you on your special day. I hope that this birthday is just the beginning of a year filled with joy and wonderful experiences.
                Once again, happy birthday, and I hope that our paths cross again soon. Ingatan at Samahan ka nawang palagi at Advance Happy Pasalamat <33! <br><br>
                With all my love, <br>
